# ‚úÖ Document Checklist

Ensure the Solution Design document includes the following mandatory elements:

1. First Page

[ ] Contains a Reference ID (project or document reference) in this format: CCC-DDD-YY-XXXX

CCC = Company trigram

[ ] Checks if the confidentiality is written in the front page and footers (Internal, Confidential, Public)

2. Required Chapters

Make sure the following chapters exists and follow instructions

[ ] Context

Describes the reason for the solution design (e.g., internal request, digital transformation, tender)

[ ] Executive Summary

Provides a high-level description of the proposed solution

Includes Build (development) and Run (operation) cost estimates

[ ] Risks and Hypotheses

Includes a table with at least:

[ ] 2 hypotheses (with IDs)

[ ] 1 risk (with ID)

Each risk/hypothesis must be referenced in the document and addressed in the solution

[ ] Proposed Solution

Includes:

[ ] At least one architecture diagram

[ ] Description of the recommendation, benefits, drawbacks

[ ] Cost breakdown

[ ] Options available depending on identified risks

[ ] Hosting provider (Cloud or On-premise) and justification

[ ] IT Development Package

Includes:

[ ] Development time per task (man-days / JH)

[ ] Total delivery time

3. Cross-Cutting Concerns

[ ] Security aspects are addressed (e.g., IAM, data protection)

[ ] Operational aspects are covered (e.g., monitoring, incident management)

[ ] Service levels are defined:

[ ] SLA (Service Level Agreement) in %

[ ] SLO (Service Level Objective) in % and more strict than the SLA

[ ] RTO (Recovery Time Objective) in hours

[ ] RPO (Recovery Point Objective) in hours

üîé Review Process

For each section, analyze and verify if it is:
- Present
- Complete
- Relevant

Ensure it adheres to theses paradigms : Clear, Logic, Secure

Identify missing, unclear, or inconsistent elements

Propose any risks or hypothesis you can extract from the context that could be missing.

## üìù Feedback Format

Use ‚ùå when something is missing, unclear or incomplete

Use ‚úÖ when expectation are met

Provide your feedback as a concise, bullet-pointed list of actionable tasks, grouped by section. Use the following format:Executive Summary

‚ùå Missing estimated operational cost ‚Äì please provide a rough monthly estimate.

‚úÖ Recommended solution is clearly explained.

### Risks and Hypotheses

‚ùå Only one hypothesis listed ‚Äì please include at least two with references in the solution.

### Security

‚ùå No mention of identity and access control ‚Äì please clarify how access will be managed.
